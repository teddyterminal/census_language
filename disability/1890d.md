It is further to be noted that the enumerator is not required to accept answers which he knows or has reason to believe are false. He has a right to a true statement on every matter respecting which he is bound to inquire. Should any person persist in making statements which are obviously erroneous, the enumerator should enter upon the schedule the facts as nearly as he can ascertain them by his own observation or by inquiry of. credible persons.

This matter becomes of special importance with reference to the statements made concerning members of families who are mentally or physically defective. The law requires a return in the case of each insane, feeble-minded, idiotic, blind, or deaf person, or such as may be crippled, maimed, or deformed. It not infrequently happens that the persons interrogated are disposed to conceal, or even to deny, the existence of such infirmities on the part of members of their household, especially as regards children. In such cases, if the fact is personally known to the enumerator, or if ascertained by inquiry from neighbors, it should be entered on the schedules the same as if obtained from the head or some member of the family.
