Perhaps after the Civil War, the Census Bureau had a change of heart, and the highly callous instructions from 1860 give way to a slightly more even-tempered passage about the need to not offend census respondents. (!) The pauper and convict questions are also gone. Still, the whole thing feels very... unfortunate.

**Deaf and Dumb, Blind, Insane, or Idiotic.-** Great care will be taken in performing this work of the enumeration, so as at once to secure completeness and avoid giving offense. Total blindness and undoubted insanity only are intended in this inquiry. Deafness merely, without loss of speech, is not to be reported. The fact of idiocy will be better determined by the common consent of the neighborhood, than by attempting to apply any scientific measure to the weakness of the mind or will.
