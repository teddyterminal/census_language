Until 1830, the census did not standardize questionnaires or instructions to U.S. Marshals. Below is an excerpt from the original Census Act of 1789 codifying the race question.

In 1800 and 1810, Free Whites were recorded with age included, but other free persons (particularly blacks) were recorded as one group. 

Races noted: White, Other Free Persons, Slave
