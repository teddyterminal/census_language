**_Question 5—Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or Hispanic, or Other Latino Origin_**

Question 5 asks if any household member is Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or of another Hispanic or Latino group.

- Show Card B, which lists various Hispanic/Latino ethnic origins.
- Read question 5: Are any of the persons that I have listed Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or of another Hispanic or Latino group? Follow the directions in this table according to the respondent’s answer for each person:
	- If yes… Mark the appropriate Yes box under the question. If “Yes, other Spanish/ Hispanic/ Latino” ask: What is this group? Print the group in the space provided. Go to Question 6.
	- If no… Mark the No box under the question for each person. Go to Question 6.

**NOTE: You must ask the respondent question 5 for every household member. Different household members may have different origins. For example, some, but not all, household members may be Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or of another Hispanic or Latino group. If certain household members are not of one of these groups, mark the box next to the description “No, not Spanish/ Hispanic/ Latino.” If the respondent refuses to give a household member’s Spanish/Hispanic/Latino origin, write “Refused #5” in the left column (see Illustration 6.5 on the next page).**

**_Question 6 – Race_**

Question 6 asks for each person’s race. Even though a person identifies himself or herself as Hispanic, you must always ask the race question. A person of Hispanic origin may be of any race. It is important that you show the respondent both cards B and C and ask both questions 5 and 6.

Show the respondent Card C, which lists the race categories.

Read question 6: **_Now choose one or more races for each person. Which race or races does each person consider himself/herself to be?_**

- Mark the box next to the race or races that the respondent identifies for each person. The respondent may select one or more races.
- If the person is an American Indian or Alaska Native, ask **_What is the name of the person’s enrolled or principal tribe?_** Print the tribe name in the space provided.
- If the person is other Asian, other Pacific Islander, or Some other race, ask, **_What is this race?_** Print the race in the space provided.
- If the person says he or she is a race not listed on the questionnaire, such as “American,” mark the “Some other race” box and write “American” in the space provided.

- If the person refuses or doesn’t know, leave blank and make a note in the margin.

**NOTE: You must ask the respondent both the Hispanic origin question (question 5) and the race question (question 6).**
