**Column 5: Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish Origin**

Column 5 is where each person is asked about his or her Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. Many people assume the question is asking about the race of the household member, but it is not. It is only asking if each person is of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin.

- Allow the respondent time to refer to List C.

- Put an ‘X’ in only one box for each person. Do not encourage more than one response, but enter more than one response if offered.

It is necessary to read this question for everyone in the household. If the person’s origin group is not one of the listed categories, put an ‘X’ in the ‘Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin’ box and print the origin response in the row of boxes under **‘What is that origin?’**

People of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin are those who trace their origin or descent to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Spanishspeaking countries of Central or South America, and other Spanish cultures. Origin can be considered as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person’s parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.

**Column 6: Race**

Column 6 is where data are collected about each household member’s race.

**Ask this question of all persons on the roster. Do not make assumptions. The responses to the race question are based on self-identification, and should not be interpreted as being scientific or genetic in nature. Enter the response given to you by the respondent.**

This is a multiple entry item; a respondent can choose more than one race. Print an ‘X’ in each box for each race the respondent selects.

If the respondent identifies with both an ethnicity and a racial group, such as ‘Puerto Rican’ and ‘White,’ ‘Cuban’ and ‘Black,’ or ‘Mexican’ and ‘Korean,’ mark only the appropriate boxes for all the groups provided. Record the additional responses that are not printed on the EQ in the appropriate available ‘write-in’ lines.

**Additional Information** Some of the responses ask for additional information. The procedures for collecting additional information for the three rows of write-in boxes are as follows:

**Top Row of Write-In Boxes** When a respondent selects, ‘American Indian or Alaska Native’ as an answer, place an ‘X’ in the box beside that race and then ask, **What is the name of the enrolled or principal tribe?** Print the response in the **top row of boxes.**

- **_Note:_** If the answer is too long to print in the spaces provided, continue printing near the ‘write-in’ area. See Figure 5-2 on page 5-8 for an example

**Middle Row of Write-In Boxes** The middle row of spaces is used when a respondent selects **either** ‘Other Asian’ or ‘Other Pacific Islander.’ The ‘Other Asian’ arrow points down to the ‘write-in’ area and the ‘Other Pacific Islander’ arrow points up to the ‘write-in’ area. Place an ‘X’ in the box beside the answer and then ask, **What is that group?** Print the response in the **middle row of boxes.**

- **_Note:_** If the answer is too long to print in the spaces provided, continue printing near the ‘write-in’ area. See Figure 5-2 on page 5-8 for an example.

**Bottom Row of Write-In Boxes** The bottom row of spaces is used when a respondent selects ‘Some other race.’ Place an ‘X’ in the box beside ‘Some other race,’ and then ask, **What is that group?** Print the response in the **bottom row of boxes.**

- **_Note:_** If the answer is too long to print in the spaces provided, continue printing near the ‘write-in’ area. See Figure 5-2 on page 5-8 for an example.

**Hispanic Origin** If the respondent states his or her race is ‘Hispanic’ or provides a specific Hispanic ethnicity you should:

- Ask the respondent to refer to List D on the D-1(F), Information Sheet, and ask if there is a group or groups listed in which the respondent identifies.

- Then ask the question again, exactly as worded “Please look at List D and choose one or more races. For this census, Hispanic origin is not a race. What is (Name’s) race?”

- Explain that race and Hispanic origin are two distinct concepts, and people of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

- If the respondent asks for clarification, explain that race and Hispanic origin are two distinct concepts, and people of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

If the respondent again answers ‘Hispanic’ or provides a specific Hispanic ethnicity, you should place an ‘X’ in the ‘Some other race’ box and print the response in the bottom row of boxes.

**Explanation of the Race Categories** The following are examples for each category and are not all inclusive:

**‘White’** The category ‘White’ refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who identify as ‘White’ or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.
