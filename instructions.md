**Item 9. Race**

114. Item 9. _Determining and entering race._- Write “W” for white; “Neg” for Negro; “Ind” for American Indian, “Chi” for Chinese, “Jap” for Japanese; “Fil” for Filipino. For a person of any other race, write the race in full. Assume that the race of related persons living in the household is the same as the race of your respondent, unless you learn otherwise. For unrelated persons (employees, hired hands, lodgers, etc.) you must ask the race, because knowledge of the housewife’s race (for example) tells nothing of the maid’s race.

115. _Mexicans._- Report “white” (W) for Mexicans unless they are definitely of Indian or other nonwhite race.

116. _Negroes.-_ Report “Negro” (Neg) for Negroes and for persons of mixed white and Negro parentage. A person of mixed Indian and Negro blood should be returned as a Negro, unless the Indian blood very definitely predominates and he is accepted in the community as an Indian. (Note, however, the exceptions described in par. 118 below.)

117. _American Indians.-_ Report “American Indian (Ind) for persons of mixed white and Indian blood if enrolled on an Indian Agency or Reservation roll; if not so enrolled, they should still be reported as Indian if the proportion of Indian blood is one-fourth or more, or if they are regarded as Indians in the community where they live. (See par. 116 for persons of mixed Indian and Negro blood and also exceptions noted in par. 118) In those counties where there are many Indians living outside of reservations, special care should be taken to obtain accurate answers to item 9.

118. _Special communities.-_ Report persons of mixed white, Negro, and Indian ancestry living in certain communities in the Eastern United States in terms of the name by which they are locally known. The communities in question are long standing and are locally recognized by special names, such as “Croatan,” “Jackson White,” “We-sort,” etc. Persons of mixed Indian and Negro ancestry and mulattoes not living in such communities should be returned as “Negro” (see par. 116). When in doubt, describe the situation in a footnote.

119. _Mixed parentage.-_ Report race of nonwhite parent for persons of mixed white and nonwhite races. Mixtures of nonwhite races should be reported according to the race of the father. (Note, however, exceptions detailed in pars. 116 and 118 above.)

120. _India.-_ Persons originating in India should be reported as “Asiatic Indians.”
