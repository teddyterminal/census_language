For item 4 (color or race), it was assumed that the respondent’s relatives living in the unit were also of the same race unless the census taker learned otherwise. The enumerator’s manual included a long list of possible written-in entries and how they were to be classified: For example, ‘‘Chicano,’’ ‘‘LaRaza,’’ ‘‘Mexican American,’’ ‘‘Moslem,’’ or ‘‘Brown’’ were to be changed to White, while ‘‘Brown (Negro)’’ would be considered as Negro or Black for census purposes.
