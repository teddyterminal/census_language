4. _Whether white, black, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, Chinese, Japanese, or Indian._

Write _white, black, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, Chinese, Japanese,_ or _Indian,_ according to the color or race of the person enumerated. Be particularly careful to distinguish between blacks, mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons. The word ‘‘black’’ should be used to describe those persons who have three-fourths or more black blood; ‘‘mulatto,’’ those persons who have from three-eighths to five-eighths black blood; ‘‘quadroon,’’ those persons who have one-fourth black blood; and ‘‘octoroon,’’ those persons who have one-eighth or any trace of black blood.
