1900
------

All references to mental health disappear in 1900, and the blind and deaf tabulations are placed on a separate question schedule from the main one. 

------

This schedule (Form 7-442) calls for the name, sex, age, and post-office address of all persons who are either blind or deaf (including those who are deaf and dumb). The instructions for filling it are printed on the schedule itself, including explicit instructions concerning the classes of blind and deaf persons, who are to be enumerated on this schedule.
