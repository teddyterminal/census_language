1.6 Under heading 6, entitled “_Color,”_ in all cases where the person is white leave the space blank; in all cases where the person is black without admixture insert the letter “B;” if a mulatto, or of mixed blood, write “M;” if an Indian, write “Ind.” It is very desirable to have these directions carefully observed.

2.5. _Color.—_ Under heading 5, entitled “_Color,_” insert, in all cases where the slave is black, the letter “B.” When he or she is a mulatto insert “M.” You are to note the color of every slave. Those who are in any degree of mixed blood are to be termed mulatto, “M.”
